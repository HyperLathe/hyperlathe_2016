                        <p>For this site to work effectively, it may place small data files called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.</p>
                        <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
                        <p>A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you donâ€™t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>
                        <p>This website uses cookies to remember that you have visited, and nothing more, and does not share any personal information with third parties.</p>
                        <h3>How to control cookies:</h3>
                        <p>You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish; for details, see <a href="http://aboutcookies.org" target="_blank">aboutcookies.org</a>. If you so choose, you can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and also set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. Doing this won't affect how this site operates, but it may affect others.</p>
