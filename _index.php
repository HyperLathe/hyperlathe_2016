                <h2>Front End Designer / Developer / UX</h2>
                <p>Hello! Welcome to my online portfolio, where you can see some examples of my <a href="design.php">design</a> and <a href="development.php">development</a> work.</p>
                <p>I have been creating web-related content since 2004, incorporating everything from wireframing, UX, prototyping, design, development, and testing.</p>
                <p>I am a huge fan of responsive design, accessibility, and clean, semantic markup, and have enjoyed working in a number of industries including e-commerce, finance, communications, and insurance, helping make websites that work and look good.</p>
                <p>Prior to my current career path, I worked as a composer and copywriter, and like to think they were both useful methodologies that influenced what I'm doing today.</p> 
                <p>Feel free to <a href="contact.php">contact me</a> or call on <strong>+44 (0)7967 639 192</strong> if you would like to discuss working together.</p>
