                <p>Well-known high-street brand <a href="http://www.annsummers.com" target="_blank">Ann Summers</a> employed me to work on designs and front-end maintenance for their online store.</p>
                <p>In 2011 the Design Department chose my visual concept for their upcoming sale campaign that was to appear in the window displays of their physical shops, as well as be that season's online sale identity.</p>
                <p>I was also responsible for the design, build and send of their html newsletters and promotional campaigns, which were emailed to almost one million people around the world every 2 - 3 days.</p>
