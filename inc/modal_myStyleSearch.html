                <p>MyStyleSearch.com was an exciting venture based around the concept of the ultimate fashion search engine.</p>
                <p>Some search engines allow you to search for items of clothing by colour or size, but My Style Search aimed to be the first that you can use to filter products by specifics such as neckline, sleeve length, dress length etc. This powerful search concept may well become the first port of call for anyone looking for a particular fashion item.</p>
                <p>I was brought on board to redesign the homepage and the existing front-end user interface, which utilised real-time database queries. I also set up an email marketing campaign template and provided regular promotional visuals for Facebook and Twitter.</p>
