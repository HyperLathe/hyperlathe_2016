                <p>Treasure8 is a San Francisco-based food innovation and technology company whose goal is to solve the nutritional challenges and environmental stresses of a growing global population.</p>
                <p>I was commissioned to build a simple web app, designed for use primarily for tablets, that presented users with a quick and ergonomic interface, allowing them to take quick surveys and offer feedback on specific food products.</p>
                <p>The final framework was built with jQuery Mobile to the client’s design specifications.</p>
