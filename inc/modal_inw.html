                <p>Ignition Northwest is a 501c3 non-profit volunteer-led arts organization that was founded by a community of artists based in Seattle and surrounding areas.</p>
                <p>Each year they set up and curate 'Critical Northwest' a week-long arts festival in the Pacific Northwest region with interactive theme camps, art installations and performance areas.</p>
                <p>Included in the welcome pack for visitors and participants, is a guide book detailing the weeks schedule, details about the art pieces, general event guidelines and more.</p>
                <p>INW approached me and asked me to design the guide book cover and contents, based upon the theme for the year. The theme for 2016 was 'Home Sweet Home' so I decided to explore the imagery and visual vernacular of Fifties Americana to create a kitsch concept of 'home', drawing upon various design iconography and advertising from the era.</p>
                <p>The final layout was produced in Adobe InDesign, and approximately a thousand copies were printed and handed out at the event.</p>
