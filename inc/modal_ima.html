                <p>Iron Monkey Arts is a blacksmithing collective based out of Seattle, Washington. They build large-scale installation art for both temporary events and permanent location. In 2016 they celebrated their tenth year making art for Burning Man, and I was asked to adapt the existing logo into a '10 year anniversary' logo that would be used for promotional items and clothing.</p>
                <p>Using the original logo design as a starting point, I adapted it to include the names of all the previous pieces, while incorporating a large 'X' to reference the 10-year anniversary. The finished design was printed on t-shirts, hoodies, bandanas and stickers.</p>
