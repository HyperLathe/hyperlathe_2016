          <p>Award-winnng MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) Lebara brought me in to primarily work on UX and build a responsive prototype for the mobile versions of their popular websites - of which there are eight, globally.</p>
            <p>The primary problem to overcome was the lack of brand continuity between the existing mobile and desktop sites. Using a combination of html and php, I built a responsive prototype on my own server, with view to consolidating both experiences and refining the existing customer journeys. The sim card topping-up process and various purchase journeys were made simpler in the process.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Using web analytics and heat-map tool MouseFlow, we invited a number of employees from Customer Services to click through the various journeys. The CS team were prime candidates for this due to their experience talking to customers and helping them navigate various online functions.</p>
            <p>With their permission, I filmed their interaction with the prototype running on a smartphone, which helped give me a clearer picture of how the different journeys took place in real-life scenarios. I then took that data and feedback and applied it to <a href="http://hyperlathe.com/clients/lebara_phase2/" target="_blank">the finished model, which you can view here</a>.</p>
            <p><a href="http://hyperlathe.com/clients/lebara_phase2/" target="_blank">This prototype allowed navigation testing for all the primary customer journeys, including sign up, top-up, and acquire new SIM card.</a></p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Further down the line, it was decided to introduce the testing and optimisation service Monetate. I implemented this by way of building an entirely different homepage layout and navigation, which I uploaded via the Monetate web app, thus creating a three-way testing split:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Existing homepage and header</li>
              <li>Existing homepage with new header and</li>
              <li>New homepage, new header</li>
            </ol>
            <p><a href="http://hyperlathe.com/clients/lebara_2014_newnav/" target="_blank">This redesigned prototype can be viewed here.</a> It was required to be non-responsive in this case, as it was only applied to the then desktop version of the site, above a certain screen resolution.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>Ultimately, the code from my prototype was implemented onto the m-site, with view to creating a more unified web experience further down the line.</p>
            <p>Due to the sleeker and more intuitive UX, online profits from the new rolled out m-site almost doubled within a few weeks of going live.</p>
