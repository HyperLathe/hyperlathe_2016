            <p>Burning Man is a week-long event that takes place once a year in Black Rock Desert, Nevada. It is an eclectic expression of creativity and a melting pot of community and culture that attracts over 70,000 attendees from all over the world.</p>
            <p>Since 2013 I have been asked to create a hi-res poster of the Great Circle Fire Conclave. On the penultimate night of the event, hundreds of fire-performers and dancers gather at the base of the 'Man' structure and it's important for them to be aware of location, safety zones etc. Since 2013 I have been asked to create a hi-res poster of the Great Circle Fire Conclave. </p>
            <p>There are two posters created, a main map showing the location of the various regional performers, the second is a detail map indicating safety boundaries, staff areas, exit points etc. The final designs are blown up and displayed in the Fire Conclave meeting point at Burning Man each year. I have also designed laminated passes for the performers and staff.</p>

            <p>Each year they set up and curate 'Critical Northwest' a week-long arts festival in the Pacific Northwest region with interactive theme camps, art installations and performance areas.</p>

            <p>INW approached me and asked me to design the guide book cover and contents, based upon the theme for the year. The theme for 2016 was 'Home Sweet Home' so I decided to explore the imagery and visual vernacular of Fifties Americana to create a kitsch concept of 'home', drawing upon various design iconography and advertising from the era.</p>
            <p>The final layout was produced in Adobe InDesign, and approximately a thousand copies were printed and handed out at the event.</p>

              <p>Some search engines allow you to search for items of clothing by colour or size, but My Style Search aimed to be the first that you can use to filter products by specifics such as neckline, sleeve length, dress length etc. This powerful search concept may well become the first port of call for anyone looking for a particular fashion item.</p>
              <p>I was brought on board to redesign the homepage and the existing front-end user interface, which utilised real-time database queries. I also set up an email marketing campaign template and provided regular promotional visuals for Facebook and Twitter.</p>

          <p>Award-winnng MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) Lebara brought me in to primarily work on UX and build a responsive prototype for the mobile versions of their popular websites - of which there are eight, globally.</p>
            <p>The primary problem to overcome was the lack of brand continuity between the existing mobile and desktop sites. Using a combination of html and php, I built a responsive prototype on my own server, with view to consolidating both experiences and refining the existing customer journeys. The sim card topping-up process and various purchase journeys were made simpler in the process.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Using web analytics and heat-map tool MouseFlow, we invited a number of employees from Customer Services to click through the various journeys. The CS team were prime candidates for this due to their experience talking to customers and helping them navigate various online functions.</p>
            <p>With their permission, I filmed their interaction with the prototype running on a smartphone, which helped give me a clearer picture of how the different journeys took place in real-life scenarios. I then took that data and feedback and applied it to <a href="http://hyperlathe.com/clients/lebara_phase2/" target="_blank">the finished model, which you can view here</a>.</p>
            <p><a href="http://hyperlathe.com/clients/lebara_phase2/" target="_blank">This prototype allowed navigation testing for all the primary customer journeys, including sign up, top-up, and acquire new SIM card.</a></p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Further down the line, it was decided to introduce the testing and optimisation service Monetate. I implemented this by way of building an entirely different homepage layout and navigation, which I uploaded via the Monetate web app, thus creating a three-way testing split:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Existing homepage and header</li>
              <li>Existing homepage with new header and</li>
              <li>New homepage, new header</li>
            </ol>
            <p><a href="http://hyperlathe.com/clients/lebara_2014_newnav/" target="_blank">This redesigned prototype can be viewed here.</a> It was required to be non-responsive in this case, as it was only applied to the then desktop version of the site, above a certain screen resolution.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, the code from my prototype was implemented onto the m-site, with view to creating a more unified web experience further down the line.</p>
            <p>Due to the sleeker and more intuitive UX, online profits from the new rolled out m-site almost doubled within a few weeks of going live.</p>

            <p>I was brought in to design and build a number of projects, including a rebuild of bostonivy.co from the ground up, and a number of financial service sites, utilising WordPress and customised PHP.
            <p>I also built working prototypes, including <a href="http://hyperlathe.com/clients/ig/bostonivy/" target="_blank">a working mockup of the Boston Ivy site.</a></p>
