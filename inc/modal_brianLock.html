                <p>Brian Lock is an internationally renowned composer who has had success both in the UK and abroad.</p>
                <p>He approached me to design and develop a new version of his website, specifying that he wanted something that would work well on all devices and screens, while giving him the ability to update and add content himself.</p>
                <p>We decided that WordPress would be the best way forward, so I chose an existing template and adapted it to Brian's requirements.</p>
                <p>Part of his specification was to include the option for multiple languages due to the success of his work in France and Poland, and also a live Twitter feed.</p>
