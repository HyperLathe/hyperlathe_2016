                <p>I was employed by Direct Line Group to work on the front-end of a new web app that is due to be rolled out. The new app is a single-page application built with AngularJS, and allows customers to be able to get an instant quote quickly and easily.</p>
                <p>This role included testing and debugging the app, adding and amending Angular content, and making html and css changes where necessary. The team had created an adaptive design approach, so I was working on separate mobile and desktop versions.</p>
                <p>I also helped create, debug, and test mobile versions of the other differently branded incarnations of the app; Churchill, Privilege and Green flag.</p>
                <p>I am unable to provide any screenshots or images of the project in question due to confidentiality and non-disclosure legalities.</p>
