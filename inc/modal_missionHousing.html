                <p>Mission Housing is a charity that aims to provide housing support and counsellors to support the needs of London’s diverse population. They reach out to the young and elderly, employed and unemployed, those with physical or mental health issues and addictions, the homeless, refugees and recent immigrants.</p>
                <p>Working through Philosophy Design, it was decided that it wasn’t possible to implement a CMS due to time and budget constraints, so I used a combination of jQuery and Bootstrap to display the static pages.</p>
